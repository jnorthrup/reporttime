reporttime.bash -- Bash support for ZSH-like REPORTTIME

Description
-----------
This script tries to provide REPORTTIME support in Bash.
It will base its timings on wall time, rather than CPU time, which
'time' uses, but that's normally what people want anyways.

Features
--------
  - Automatically displays timings for commands executing longer
    than REPORTTIME seconds
  - Easy to use variables for fancy Bash prompts ('rttime',
    'rthours', 'rtmins' etc)
  - Command for displaying how long the last command executed
    ('timelast')
  - Customizable precision of timings
